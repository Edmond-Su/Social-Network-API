# Social-Network-API

## Description

A backend API that allows the user to manage a social network database. The purpose of this project was to familiarise myself with MongoDB and Mongoose. This project allowed me to get a better understanding of how to use MongoDB methods and queries.

This backend API allows a user to view all existing users in the databse through HTTP GET requests. The API also allows the user to create new users, update and delete existing users for the database. The API also allows the user to have social network users add other users as friends and remove friends.

The API also allows the user to view "thoughts" which are posts that users on the social network create. These thoughts can be created, edited and deleted through the API as well. The API also allows the creation and deletion of reactions for thoughts.

## Installation
